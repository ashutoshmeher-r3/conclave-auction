This is a sample use case for R3's Conclave Confidential Computing Platform.
It allows bidders to confidentially submit their bids to an enclave (A protected 
region of memory which cannot be accessed by the OS, Kernel or BIOS). The bids are 
processed confidentially in the enclave and the result is returned to concerned parties.
